These are a collection of introductory articles that can help you to learn how to use Hypothesis
effectively. You don't have to read all of these to get started! Feel free to dip in and out as
the mood takes you.

We recommend the following reading order:

1. [Getting started with Hypothesis](/articles/getting-started-with-hypothesis/)
2. [Testing performance optimizations](/articles/testing-performance-optimizations/)
3. [The Encode/Decode Invariant](/articles/encode-decode-invariant)
4. [Rule Based Stateful Testing](/articles/rule-based-stateful-testing)

After that, either just experiment with Hypothesis on your own, with [help from the documentation](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io),
or check out some of [the other articles here](/articles/) for more inspiration.
