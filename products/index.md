## Hypothesis for Python

This is our current primary focus and the only currently production ready
implementation of the Hypothesis design.

It features:

* A full implementation of [property based testing](
  {{site.url}}{% post_url  2016-05-13-what-is-property-based-testing %}) for
  Python, including [stateful testing]({{site.url}}{% post_url  2016-04-19-rule-based-stateful-testing %}).
* An extensive library of data generators and tools for writing your own.
* Compatible with py.test, unittest, nose and Django testing, and probably many
  others besides.
* Support for Python 2.7 (including pypy), 3.4 and 3.5. Support for Python 2.6
  is also available as a separate package, see below.
* Open source under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/)

To use Hypothesis for Python, simply add the *hypothesis* package to your requirements,
or *pip install hypothesis* directly.

The code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis-python)
and documentation is available [on readthedocs](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/).

### Hypothesis Legacy Support

If you want to run Hypothesis under Python 2.6, there is a separate
package to install called hypothesislegacysupport. Unlike Hypothesis this is made
available under the [GNU Affero General Public License 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

Hypothesis Legacy Support has versions which match Hypothesis versions precisely
and adds no functionality other than extended version support.

If you want to use it under more permissive terms, an alternate commercial license
is available on request: Email us at [licensing@hypothesis.works](mailto:licensing@hypothesis.works)
for details.

If you need support for other end of lifed versions of Python, feel free to email
us to discuss the possibility of us adding that to Hypothesis Legacy Support too.

## Hypothesis for Java

Hypothesis for Java is currently a *feasibility prototype* only and is not ready
for production use. We are looking for initial customers to help fund getting it
off the ground.

As a prototype it currently features:

* Enough of the core Hypothesis model to be useful.
* Good JUnit integration.
* A small library of data generators.

The end goal is for Hypothesis for Java to have feature parity with Hypothesis
for Python, and to take advantage of the JVM's excellent concurrency support
to provide parallel testing of your code, but it's not there yet.

The current prototype is released under the AGPL3 (this is not the intended
license for the full version, which will most likely be Apache licensed) and
is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis-java).

Email us at [hello@hypothesis.works](mailto:hello@hypothesis.works) if you want
to know more about Hypothesis for Java or want to discuss being an early customer
of it.

## Hypothesis for Cucumber

At the moment, this is just an idea we're exploring. We'd like to make property
based testing tools available to a wider audience, including non-programmers who
work as testers. Using Hypothesis with [Cucumber](http://cucumber.io/) seems
like a great potential route into that.

If this is something you'd like to talk about, email us at
[hello@hypothesis.works](mailto:hello@hypothesis.works) and we can talk.
